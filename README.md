# RayTracer

Simple ray tracer for on-line course.

The project was rapidly prototyped and has some resulting limitations:

Most of the source is in header files. It's not a problem for such small project.
The project is not optimized for performance or memory footprint.

The precision of renderer was specially reduced to produce images suitable for automatic evaluation and course credit.

## Features

  Raytracing with varying tracing depth
  Directional and point lights
  Antialiasing
  Basic materials
  Global illumination
  Text file based to define the world
