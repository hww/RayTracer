# RayTracer

Simple ray tracer for on-line course.

The project was rapidly prototyped and has some resulting limitations:

Most of the source is in header files. It's not a problem for such small project.
The project is not optimized for performance or memory footprint.

(The renderer's precision is reduced in this published source code, to not produce images that could be used for course credit.)

## Features

- Raytracing with varying tracing depth
- Directional and point lights
- Antialiasing
- Basic materials
- Global illumination
- Text file based to define the world
